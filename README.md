# Hi there... :wave:
... I'm Zheng Yew. Welcome to my Github page! I'm a:
- Final-year university student
- Taking Computer Science and Design (CSD)
- Studying at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).

Yes, we like acronyms :laughing:

I have another account, [snproj](https://github.com/snproj), which I'm slowly moving to, so if you see links here to that page's repos, that's why!

## :thumbsup: Some things I've done...
- Shell scripting to automate tasks and tests
- Experimenting with various Linux distros
- Experimenting with writing a kernel (with guidance of course)
- Living in the command-line ecosystem (I'll admit I went through a Unix ricing phase)
- FPGA programming
- Web development (Frontend and backend)
- API interactions/Web scraping
- Simple machine learning/data analysis

## :pencil: Languages I've used...

I'm most familiar with:
- C/C++
- Java
- Python
- Javascript
- Bash

But I've done projects with a wide range of languages!

| Database | [PostgreSQL](#postgresql) |
| Markup | [HTML/CSS](#htmlcssjs), [LaTeX](#latex), [Markdown](#markdown) |
| FPGA | [Lucid HDL](#lucid-hdl) |
| Scientific | [GNU Octave](#gnu-octave) |

## :computer: Technologies I've used
| Type | Technologies |
| --- | --- |
| Web development / other web technologies | Spring Boot, Heroku, Selenium, Postman, jQuery, Flask, Jinjja, Bootstrap |
| Databases | PostgreSQL, Firebase |

| Miscellaneous | Git, SSH, SCP |

## :school: I'm currently learning...
- [Kernel development](https://www.udemy.com/course/developing-a-multithreaded-kernel-from-scratch/) course (corresponding to [this](https://github.com/snproj/sunriseKernel) project)
- [Network fundamentals](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start/) (CCNA)
- More web development tools:
  - [React](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)
  - [Node.js + Express + Mongodb](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/)

## :telescope: I'm interested in...
- Low-level computing and operating systems
- Programming language design
- Network infrastructure and protocols
- AI/ML/DL (not aboard the hype train, but the fundamentals seem interesting so I'm eager to explore the general field)
